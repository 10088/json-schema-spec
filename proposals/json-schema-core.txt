                            json-schema-core

Abstract

   JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON
   based format for defining the structure of JSON data.  JSON Schema
   provides a contract for what JSON data is required for a given
   application and how to interact with it.  JSON Schema is intended to
   define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation, and
   interaction control of JSON data.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


1.  Introduction

   JSON Schema is a JSON media type for defining the structure of JSON
   data.  JSON Schema provides a contract for what JSON data is required
   for a given application and how to interact with it.  JSON Schema is
   intended to define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation,
   and interaction control of JSON data.

   This document defines the core terminology used by JSON Schema.
   Other linked specifications, which expand on a particular role of
   JSON Schema, will use that terminology.

   This document also defines the mechanisms used for JSON Schema
   identification and referencing.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms "JSON", "JSON text", "JSON value", "member", "element",
   "object", "array", "number", "string", "boolean", "true", "false",
   and "null" in this document are to be interpreted as defined in RFC
   4627 [RFC4627].

3.  Core terminology of JSON Schema

3.1.  JSON Schema, keywords

   A JSON Schema is a JSON document, and that document MUST be an
   object.  Object members of a JSON Schema are called keywords, or
   schema keywords.

   A JSON Schema MAY be empty.

3.2.  Root schema, subschema

   JSON Schemas can be nested, as in this example:


   {
       "title": "root",
       "otherschema": {
           "title": "nested",
           "anotherschema": {
               "title": "alsonested"
           }

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


       }
   }


   In this example, "nested" and "alsonested" are subschemas, and "root"
   is a root schema.

3.3.  JSON Schema primitive types

   JSON Schema defines seven primitive types for JSON values:

   array  A JSON array.

   boolean  A JSON boolean (true or false).

   integer  A JSON number without a decimal or exponent part (see RFC
      4627, section 2.4 [RFC4627].

   number  Any JSON number.  Number includes integer.

   null  The JSON null value.

   object  A JSON object.

   string  A JSON string.

3.4.  JSON value equality

   Two JSON values are said to be equal if and only if:

      both are nulls; or

      both are booleans, and have the same value; or

      both are strings, and have the same value; or

      both are numbers, and have the same JSON representation; or

      both are arrays, and:

         have the same number of elements; and

         elements at the same index are equal according to this
         definition; or

      both are objects, and:

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


         have the same set of members; and

         values for a same member are equal according to this
         definition.

3.5.  Instance

   An instance is any JSON value being processed by a JSON Schema.  The
   specification may also refer to an instance as a JSON instance.

4.  Overview

   JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json" for
   describing the structure of JSON instances.  JSON Schemas are
   themselves written in JSON and include facilities for describing the
   structure of JSON in terms of allowable values, descriptions, and
   interpreting relations with other resources.

   JSON Schema serves different purposes, which are summarized below.
   Each purpose has a defined set of keywords which is described in its
   own specification.

4.1.  Instance validation

   JSON Schema allows applications to validate any JSON instance, either
   noninteractively or interactively.  For instance, an application may
   use an external service to collect JSON instances and check that
   these collected instances match its requirements against a given
   schema; another application may use a schema to build an interactve
   interface in order to collect user input, and check the correctness
   of said input.

4.2.  Hyperlinking

   JSON Schema defines a mechanism to build links to a variety of
   resources.  FIXME: describe it better.

5.  Design discussion

5.1.  Generic considerations

   It is acknowledged that JSON values can be of any type defined by the
   JSON specification.  As such, JSON Schema does not mandate that an
   instance be of a particular type: JSON Schema can process any JSON
   value, including null.  It is the domain of JSON Schema validation to
   add useful constraints to the structure and, optionally, semantics,
   of the JSON instance being processed.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


   JSON Schema is agnostic with regards to both protocols and
   programming languages.  In particular, the semantics of the client-
   server interface is dependent on the protocol being used.  This
   specification nevertheless suggests mechanisms to correlate an
   instance to a schema over HTTP, which is the dominant protocol used
   for Internet-enabled interactive applications.

5.2.  The "$schema" keyword

5.2.1.  Purpose

   The "$schema" keyword plays two roles in JSON Schema:

      it defines the version of the schema which a particular JSON
      Schema is valid against;

      it is a URI which is a location to a JSON Schema which validates
      any schema written for this version.

   Any of these schemas also validate themselves successfully.

5.2.2.  Valid values

   The value of this keyword MUST be one of the following string values:

      "http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema#" (core JSON Schema
      written against JSON Schema, draft v3 [json-schema-03]);

      "http://json-schema.org/draft-03/hyper-schema#" (JSON Schema
      hyperschema written against JSON Schema, draft v3
      [json-schema-03]);

      "http://json-schema.org/current/schema-core.json#" (schema written
      against the current version of the specification -- this one).

5.2.3.  Usage

   It is RECOMMENDED that schema authors include this keyword in their
   schemas.  This keyword MUST be located at the root of a schema.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations not supporting a particular
   schema version fail JSON Schema processing.

5.3.  Extending JSON Schema

   Implementations MAY choose to define additional keywords to JSON
   Schema.  Save for explicit agreement, schema authors SHALL NOT expect
   these additional keywords to be supported by peer implementations.

6.  Schema addressing

6.1.  Addressing mechanisms and general considerations

   JSON Schema addressing is done using URIs [RFC3986].  Two addressing
   mechanisms are defined: canonical addressing and inner schema
   addressing.  Implementations MUST support canonical addressing, and
   MAY support inner schema addressing.

   Inner schema addressing is done by the means of the "id" keyword.
   The value of this keyword MUST be a string; this string MUST be a
   valid URI, and SHOULD be normalized.

6.2.  URI of a root schema

   When a schema is loaded via a URI, the loading URI SHALL be
   considered to be the URI for this schema.  If a schema is loaded
   without a URI:

      if "id" is present in the root schema, its value MAY be considered
      to be the schema URI;

      otherwise, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations consider that
      the URI of the schema is either the empty URI, or a URN.

6.3.  Canonical addressing

   Canonical addressing in JSON Schema is done using JSON Reference
   [json-reference].  JSON References, when encountered, MUST be
   resolved against the root schema URI before being processed.

6.4.  Inner schema addressing

   When "id" is encountered in a subschema, implementations MAY resolve
   this URI against the root schema's URI, and consider that the
   canonical URI of this subschema is the calculated URI.  This is
   called inner schema addressing.

   There SHOULD NOT be two identical "id" values in the same schema
   which resolve to the same URI.  If this is the case, subschema lookup
   using inner schema addressing is undefined.

   This schema will be taken as an example:

   {
       "id": "http://x.y.z/rootschema.json#",
       "schema1": {
           "id": "#foo"
       },
       "schema2": {
           "id": "otherschema.json",
           "nested": {
               "id": "#bar"
           },
           "alsonested": {
               "id": t/inner.json#a"
           }
       },
       "schema3": {
           "id": "some://where.else/completely#"
       }
   }


   Subschemas at the following URI-encoded JSON Pointer [json-pointer]s
   (starting from the root schema) have the following URIs:

   # (document root)  http://x.y.z/rootschema.json#

   #/schema1  http://x.y.z/rootschema.json#foo

   #/schema2  http://x.y.z/otherschema.json#

   #/schema2/nested  http://x.y.z/rootschema.json#bar

   #/schema2/alsonested  http://x.y.z/t/inner.json#a

   #/schema3  some://where.else/completely#

6.5.  Security considerations

   Inner schema addressing can produce canonical URIs which differ from
   the canonical URI of the root schema.  Implementations MAY choose,
   for security reasons, to ignore inner schema addressing, and always
   dereference canonical URIs.  Schema authors SHALL NOT expect that
   inner schema addressing be used by an implementation.

   Dereferencing URIs may fail to complete, or may lead to content which
   is not a JSON Schema (another type of JSON value, or not a JSON
   value).  It is RECOMMENDED that JSON Schema processing be stopped in
   such a situation.

7.  Schema/Instance Association

7.1.  Purpose of this section

   A JSON instance MAY be correlated to one, or even several, JSON
   Schemas.  This correlation MAY be embodied within existing protocol
   headers.

   In addition, if the protocol also carries media type information (by
   means, for instance, of a "Content-Type" header), an instance MUST be
   one of "application/json" or any other subtype.

   Should the scenario above be inapplicable, due either to the absence
   of, or restrictions on, protocol headers, such a correlation is out
   of the normative scope of this specification.

7.2.  Recommended correlation mechanisms for use with the HTTP protocol

   It is acknowledged by this specification that the majority of
   interactive JSON Schema processing will be over HTTP.  This section
   therefore gives recommendations for materializing an instance/schema
   correlation using mechanisms currently available for this protocol.

7.2.1.  Correlation by means of the "Content-Type" header

   It is RECOMMENDED that a MIME type parameter by the name of "profile"
   be appended to the "Content-Type" header of the instance being
   processed.  If present, the value of this parameter MUST be a valid
   URI, and this URI SHOULD resolve to a valid JSON Schema.

   An example of such a header would be:


   Content-Type: application/my-media-type+json;
                 profile=http://example.com/my-hyper-schema


7.2.2.  Correlation by means of the "Link" header

   When using the "Link" header, it is RECOMMENDED that a relationship
   by the name "describedBy" be used, as defined by RFC 2048, section
   19.6.2.4 (FIXME: make real link).  Note: it should be remembered that
   relationship values are case insensitive, so "describedBy" is just as
   valid a relationship as "DESCRIBEDBY".

   The target URI of the "Link" header SHOULD be a valid JSON Schema.

   An example of such a header would be:

   Link: <http://example.com/my-hyper-schema>; rel="describedBy"


8.  IANA Considerations

   The proposed MIME media type for JSON Schema is defined as follows:

      type name: application;

      subtype name: schema+json.
