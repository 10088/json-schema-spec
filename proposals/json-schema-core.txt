               JSON Schema: core definitions and purposes
                            json-schema-core

Abstract

   JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON
   based format for defining the structure of JSON data.  JSON Schema
   provides a contract for what JSON data is required for a given
   application and how to interact with it.  JSON Schema is intended to
   define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation, and
   interaction control of JSON data.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


1.  Introduction

   JSON Schema is a JSON media type for defining the structure of JSON
   data.  JSON Schema provides a contract for what JSON data is required
   for a given application and how to interact with it.  JSON Schema is
   intended to define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation,
   and interaction control of JSON data.

   This document defines the core terminology used by JSON Schema.
   Other linked specifications, which expand on a particular role of
   JSON Schema, will use that terminology.

   This document also defines the mechanisms used for JSON Schema
   identification and referencing.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms "JSON", "JSON text", "JSON value", "member", "element",
   "object", "array", "number", "string", "boolean", "true", "false",
   and "null" in this document are to be interpreted as defined in RFC
   4627 [RFC4627].

3.  Core terminology of JSON Schema

3.1.  JSON Schema, keywords

   A JSON Schema is a JSON document, and that document MUST be an
   object.  Object members of a JSON Schema are called keywords, or
   schema keywords.

   A JSON Schema MAY be empty.

3.2.  Enclosing schema, root schema

   JSON Schemas can be nested, as in this example:


   {
       "title": "root",
       "otherschema": {
           "title": "nested",
           "anotherschema": {
               "title": "alsonested"
           }

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


       }
   }


   In this example, the enclosing schema of both "nested" and
   "alsonested" is "root".  The schema with title "root" is said to be a
   root schema because it is not enclosed within another schema.  The
   enclosing schema of a root schema is itself.

3.3.  JSON Schema primitive types

   JSON Schema defines seven primitive types for JSON values:

   array  A JSON array.

   boolean  A JSON boolean (true or false).

   integer  A JSON number without a decimal part.

   number  Any JSON number.  Number includes integer.

   null  The JSON null value.

   object  A JSON object.

   string  A JSON string.

3.4.  JSON value equality

   Two JSON values are said to be equal if and only if:

      both are nulls; or

      both are booleans or strings, and have the same value; or

      both are numbers, and have the same JSON reprensetation; or

      both are arrays, and:

         have the same number of elements; and

         elements at the same index are equal according to this
         definition; or

      both are objects, and:

         have the same set of members; and

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


         values for a same member are equal according to this
         definition.

   Note about numbers: the two JSON number values, 1.0 and 1, for
   instance, are mathematically equivalent; however they are NOT equal,
   since their JSON representation differs.

3.5.  Instance

   An instance is any JSON value being processed by a JSON Schema.  The
   specification may also refer to an instance as a JSON instance.

4.  Overview

   JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json" for
   describing the structure of JSON instances.  JSON Schemas are
   themselves written in JSON and include facilities for describing the
   structure of JSON in terms of allowable values, descriptions, and
   interpreting relations with other resources.

   JSON Schema serves different purposes, which are summarized below.
   Each purpose has a defined set of keywords which is described in its
   own specification.

   Documentation  JSON Schema can be used to decorate either itself, or
      instances, with descriptive text highlighting the schema's, or
      instance's, purposes.

   Hyperlinking  JSON Schema can be used to associate an instance to a
      Link Description Object, as defined by FIXME.

   Validation  JSON Schema can be used to validate the structure of an
      instance.  Keywords also exist for semantic analysis, although
      implementations are not required to implement them.

4.1.  Design Considerations

   JSON Schema provides a separate format for flexibly communicating how
   a JSON value should be interpreted and/or validated, such that
   clients can properly understand acceptable structures for, and/or
   extract the needed information from, the JSON instance being
   processed.  This information ranges from documentation to external
   resource links, and processing of these links.

   It is acknowledged that JSON values can be of any type defined by the
   JSON specification.  As such, JSON Schema does not mandate that an
   instance be of a particular type: JSON Schema can process any JSON
   value, including null.  It is the domain of JSON Schema validation to

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


   add useful constraints to the structure and, optionally, semantics,
   of the JSON instance being processed.

   JSON Schema is agnostic with regards to both protocols and
   programming languages.  In particular, this means that defining the
   semantics of the client-server interface is dependent on the protocol
   being used.

5.  Schema identification: the "id" keyword

5.1.  Usage

   Schema authors MAY choose to use the "id" keyword to add
   identification information to a JSON Schema.  The value of this
   keyword MUST be a string, and this string MUST be a valid URI.  The
   URI MUST be normalized.

   When used in a root schema, the URI SHOULD be absolute and have no,
   or an empty, fragment part.  Failing that, an implementation MAY
   choose to ignore the "id" value.  It is RECOMMENDED that when used in
   subschemas, the URI be relative.  In subschemas, "id" MUST NOT be the
   empty fragment ("#").

   In a same schema, there SHOULD NOT be two equivalent "id" values.
   Failing that, as JSON objects do not define an order for members, URI
   resolution is undefined.

   Implementations MUST consider that a URI with no fragment part is
   equivalent to this same URI with an empty fragment part.

5.2.  Inner schema addressing

   When "id" is encountered in a subschema, implementations MAY resolve
   this URI against the root schema's URI, and consider that the
   canonical URI of this subschema is the calculated URI.  This is
   called inner schema addressing.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


   This schema will be taken as an example:




   Subschemas at the following URI-encoded JSON Pointers (starting from
   the root of the schema) have the following URIs:

      http://x.y.z/rootschema.json#

      http://x.y.z/rootschema.json#foo

      http://x.y.z/otherschema.json#

      http://x.y.z/rootschema.json#bar

      http://x.y.z/t/inner.json#a

5.3.  Security considerations

   Inner schema addressing can produce canonical URIs which differ from
   the canonical URI of the root schema.  Implementations therefore MAY
   choose, for security reasons, to ignore inner schema addressing, and
   always dereference canonical URIs.

   As such, schema authors SHALL NOT expect that inner schema addressing
   be used by an implementation.

6.  Schema/Instance Association

6.1.  Purpose of this section

   A JSON instance MAY be correlated to one, or even several, JSON
   Schemas.  This correlation MAY be embodied witin existing protocol
   headers.

   In addition, if the protocol also carries media type information (by
   means, for instance, of a "Content-Type" header), an instance MUST be
   one of "application/json" or any other subtype.

   Should the scenario above be inapplicable, due either to the absence
   of, or restrictions on, protocol headers, such a correlation is out
   of the normative scope of this specification.

6.2.  Recommended correlation mechanisms for use with the HTTP protocol

   It is acknowledged by this specification that the majority of
   interactive JSON Schema processing will be over HTTP.  This section



Galiegue, et al.         Expires March 20, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                September 2012


   therefore gives recommendations for materializing an instance/schema
   correlation using mechanisms currently available for this protocol.

6.2.1.  Correlation by means of the "Content-Type" header

   It is RECOMMENDED that a MIME type parameter by the name of "profile"
   be appended to the "Content-Type" header of the instance being
   processed.  If present, the value of this parameter MUST be a valid
   URI, and this URI SHOULD resolve to a valid JSON Schema.

   An example of such a header would be:


   Content-Type: application/my-media-type+json;
                 profile=http://example.com/my-hyper-schema


6.2.2.  Correlation by means of the "Link" header

   When using the "Link" header, it is RECOMMENDED that a relationship
   by the name "describedBy" be used, as defined by RFC 2048, section
   19.6.2.4 (FIXME: make real link).  Note: it should be remembered that
   relationship values are case insensitive, so "describedBy" is just as
   valid a relationship as "DESCRIBEDBY".

   The target URI of the "Link" header SHOULD be a valid JSON Schema.

   An example of such a header would be:


   Link: <http://example.com/my-hyper-schema>; rel="describedBy"


7.  IANA Considerations

   The proposed MIME media type for JSON Schema is defined as follows:

      type name: application;

      subtype name: schema+json;

      required parameters: profile.

      FIXME: fragment resolution?
